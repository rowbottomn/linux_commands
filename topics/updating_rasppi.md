#Updating the Raspberry Pi
The raspberry pi runs on Raspian, a flavour of Linux aimed at the Raspi specifically.  
The version you are using is probably older.  Versions are named in alphabetical order.
Jessie is then more recent than Buster.
## Steps to Update
1. Update the Repository links stored on the raspi's.  
```sudo apt update```
2. Run the upgrade command to actually install using the new updated repos.  
```sudo apt upgrade```
That's all!
